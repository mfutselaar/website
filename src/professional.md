        <h2>Professional</h2>
        <p>I've been dabbling in software development since 1992-ish, where I started out with Basic, and eventually
            transitioned into Pascal and then Delphi. Then when the Internet became accessible, I started out with
            HTML on sites such as Geocities and Angelfire, and eventually moved on to PHP development (PHP3).</p>
        <p>Since then I have been mainly a PHP developer, going from (what is now considered) Full Stack to backend
            only.</p>
        <p>I have specialized myself in API and Laravel Development since 2012.</p>
        <p>Apart from PHP I am also proficient in C# and SQL (primarily MySQL and Maria). Other languages and
            frameworks I have experience with are Javascript (VueJS, NodeJS), C++, Pascal, Kotlin
            (Jetpack Compose), Sass, Python and Java. I am not bound to one language or framework specifically, and
            like to explore to see what other options can do for me in my personal space.</p>
        <p>The same goes out for other tools and techniques. I am proficient with Gitlab, Gitea, Docker, CI/CD and
            many others.</p>
