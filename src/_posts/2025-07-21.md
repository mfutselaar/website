I needed a simple command-line tool to control my Hue with. There's not much to say about that other than
that you can download it from [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/mfutselaar/huecontrol).

Yes, I went for the least obvious language, but for me, it made sense because I had PHP already installed on
my computer and there were a couple of libraries available.

With this script you can control various lights registered with a Hue hub. You can toggle them on or off,
change the color, brightness and temperatures, all from a terminal.

If you are looking for something simple to control your lights with, and do not mind that it is written in PHP, 
go check it out on [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/mfutselaar/huecontrol)!
