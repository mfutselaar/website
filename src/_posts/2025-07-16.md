Recently I made the concious decision to move from Windows to Linux permanently, after running it in a dual boot system
for years. I might explain why in a future post, but for now I just want to share something simple that I made.

One of the tools in Windows that I would always install first was [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/). It theoretically
works on Linux, but as the [developer said on the Github repository](https://github.com/xflux-gui/fluxgui), it is barely
maintained and you should use something else instead.

I ended up using gammastep, since this is a lightweight service that works on Wayland and changes the temperature
gradually (this was a big requirement for me). The only f.lux feature it was missing (and one I use a lot) was to
"temporarily disable" it.

After some tinkering in NeoVim, I managed to create a script that does exactly that. It checks if the service is
running, and if it is it will kill it and start an `at` job to restart it in an hour. It also makes sure you will not
have this job queued multiple times and it will send a notification whenever it starts or stops.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

noti() {
    notify-send -i ~/.local/share/gammastep/gammastep.svg -a "Gammastep" "Gammastep" "$@"
}

if [ -f "$HOME/.local/share/gammastep/at.id" ]; then
    atrm $(cat $HOME/.local/share/gammastep/at.id)
    rm $HOME/.local/share/gammastep/at.id
fi

GAMMAID=$(pidof gammastep)

if [ "$GAMMAID" == "" ];
then
    noti "Starting service"
    gammastep &!
else
    noti "Stopping service, restarting in 1 hour"
    kill -9 $GAMMAID
    TID=`at now + 1 hour -f "$HOME/.local/bin/gammastep-toggle.sh" 2>&1 |awk '/job/ {print $2}'`
    echo $TID > $HOME/.local/share/gammastep/at.id
fi
```

To bind this in Sway (or i3), you can use the binding `bindsym Alt+End exec --no-startup-id
~/.local/bin/gammastep-toggle.sh`

All of this assumes you put the script inside `~/.local/bin/gammastep-toggle.sh` and you have your gammastep
configuration set up in `~/.local/share/gammastep`
